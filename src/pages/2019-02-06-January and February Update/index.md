  4. Created a linked youtube channel.
     * ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zzrot/image/upload/v1549429128/slowpacedcoding.com/January%20Update/youtube.png)

  I have a lot of work to do when it comes to building my own brand. Currently the highest priority is to make the blog work on gatsby. I did a lot of research online just to learn how to work with react as well as how to build a blog on gatsby. 



#### Pending Projects In Near Future

* Rebuilt my portfolio.
  * Change the color theme to my own one.
  * Add in recent project (trick2g.site)
  * **Should I use REACT to do this?? Or it is not necessary**

* trick2g.site final version, version 4.
  * Needs a UI change up
  * Make the youtube video section an infinite scrollable one.
  * Hence keep learning about HTTP request, API calls, AJAX, fetch, async await.



#### Long term goal

* FreeCodeCamp's data structure and algorithms cert
* Colt Steele's [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
* Learn a Framework.
