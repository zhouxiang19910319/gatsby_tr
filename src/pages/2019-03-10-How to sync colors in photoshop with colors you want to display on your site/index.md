# How to sync colors in photoshop with colors you want to display on your site

If you are running into issues that with the same color code (for example: #F47C48) the color you see in your photoshop file is slightly different than the color you see on your site. Here is a couple of solutions.

#### 1. In Photoshop, go to Image > Mode and make sure it is set to "RGB"

#### 2. Go to Edit > Color Settings and check RGB mode is set to "sRGB IEC61966-2.1"

By now, the color you see in your photoshop project should be the same you see in the webpage.
